		<button id="click" onclick="click_button()">Click me</button>
		
		<p>Here the button adds a class to the box. Since the class has a style, the 
		adding the class changes the appearance of the box. Classes are like that. Once
		the class has been added clicking the button again doesn't add the class a 
		second time. I bet you can test that with the inspector.</p>
		
		<p>Notice the second line, in the script below. Uncomment this line and the
		comment the line above. When you toggle something your are switching it's state.
		The light switch is a toggle switch. It has two states. When you toggle a class
		you are removing the class if it exists, or adding it if it doesn't. </p>
		
		<p>You can also remove a class. What do you think the last line will do? I don't 
		think you will like it.</p>
